Summitpost

This script scrapes all the "Mountains & Rocks" pages on www.summitpost.org and creates a KML file which plots them in Google Earth. Each placemark in Google Earth contains the name and altitude of the mountain or rock and a link to its summitpost page.

The coordinates are provided by users on the website and accuracy varies. Some are clearly wrong.
